# Ransomware-Behavior-Analysis

## Overview
This project aims to analyze and detect ransomware activities by identifying behavioral patterns. By monitoring file operations and system logs, we use machine learning techniques to classify suspicious activities and flag potential threats.

## Features
- **Behavior Monitoring:** Track file system activities like file renaming, encryption, and deletion.
- **Real-time Detection:** Flag suspicious patterns indicative of ransomware attacks.
- **Visual Analysis:** Dashboards to visualize ransomware behaviors.

## Project Goals
1. Identify ransomware-specific patterns in system logs.
2. Implement machine learning models for behavior analysis.
3. Enable real-time monitoring and threat detection.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn, PyTorch
- **Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Data Processing:** Log parsing and feature engineering

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Nikosane/ransomware-behavior-analysis.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
  ```
  cd ransomware-behavior-analysis
  ```
3. Install dependencies:
